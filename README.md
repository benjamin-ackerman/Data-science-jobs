This repository contains all files related to my project for the first term of Advanced Data Science at JHSPH, in which I explore trends in data science job listings on Stack Overflow. *Due to data privacy issues, the data are stored separately, and are only accessible with permission from their owner.*

Here is some helpful information to locate relevant files and code:
- **final_report/**: contains final report and relevant code
- **writeup.Rmd**: code to read in private data and generate report
- **draft_report/**: contains draft report and code submitted for feedback prior to due date
- **projectplan.Rmd**: original analysis plan (these plans are outdated and do not reflect the final product)
- **finalproject.Rmd**: contains code to scrape online job boards (Stack Overflow and Datajobs.com) for data and create exploratory data analysis plots
