## Trends in Data Science Job Postings on Stack Overflow

This repository contains all files related to my project for the first term of Advanced Data Science at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, in which I explore trends in data science job listings on Stack Overflow. *Due to data privacy issues, the data are stored separately, and are only accessible with permission from their owner.*

**To access the final report, along with all relevant code, please see the "final_report/" directory**

Here is some helpful information to locate all relevant files and code:
- **final_report/**: contains final report and relevant code
- **writeup.Rmd**: code to read in private data and generate report
- **draft_report/**: contains draft report and code submitted for feedback prior to due date
- **projectplan.Rmd**: original analysis plan (these plans are outdated and do not reflect the final product)
- **finalproject.Rmd**: contains code to scrape online job boards (Stack Overflow and Datajobs.com) for data and create exploratory data analysis plots
